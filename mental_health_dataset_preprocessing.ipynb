        "*   **Purpose:** This code block loads the dataset named `mental-heath-in-tech-2016_20161114.csv` into a pandas DataFrame (`df`). It then performs an initial exploration of the data by printing its shape, a summary of column information (`.info()`), and a list of all column names.\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** The dataset contains 1433 entries and 63 columns. It includes a mix of `int64`, `float64`, and `object` data types. Many columns have non-null counts lower than the total entries, indicating the presence of missing values. The column names are verbose and descriptive, reflecting the survey questions.\n"

        "*   **Purpose:** This code block defines a comprehensive set of NA-like tokens and empty/whitespace-only strings in the DataFrame by converting them to `np.nan`. It then generates a detailed audit report for missing and 'dirty' data, showing counts and percentages of NaNs, empty strings, space-only strings, and NA-like tokens for each column.\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** The initial cleaning converted many non-standard missing values into `np.nan`. The audit revealed that several columns have a high percentage of missing values (e.g., `tech_role_flag` with 81.65% missing, `mh_coverage_flag2` with 79.97% missing). Columns like `why/why_not` and `why/why_not2` also have significant missing data after this step, confirming the need for further imputation or dropping these columns.\n",

        "*   **Purpose:** This code iterates through all `object` type columns in `df_view` and explicitly replaces string representations like `'nan'`, `'NaN'`, and `'NAN'` with the numerical `np.nan`. This ensures consistency in how missing values are represented, which is crucial for subsequent numerical operations and `isnull()` checks.\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** All string representations of 'nan' in object columns have been successfully converted to `np.nan`. This step further standardizes missing value representation, making the `isnull().sum()` output more accurate. The total missing values per column are now properly counted, showing a consolidated view of missingness."

The `mh_coverage_flag` column was also simplified from three unique values to `['No', 'Yes']` and `NaN` values. This standardization is critical for preparing these categorical columns for numerical encoding."

        "*   **Purpose:** This block performs extensive cleaning and standardization of the `sex` column, mapping numerous variations (e.g., 'Male', 'male', 'M', 'Cis male') into a few standardized categories ('Male', 'Female', 'Other', 'Prefer not to say'). It then applies one-hot encoding to create new binary columns for each `sex` category and converts these boolean columns to integers (0s and 1s). Additionally, it recodes `comp_no_empl`, `country_live`, and `country_work` for plotting ease and imputes outliers and NaNs in the `age` column using the median age within a reasonable range (18-75).\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** The `sex` column was successfully standardized into `Male`, `Female`, `Other`, and `Prefer not to say` and then one-hot encoded, creating `sex_Female`, `sex_Male`, `sex_Other`, `sex_Prefer not to say` columns. The `age` column was cleaned by replacing outliers (ages outside 18-75) and missing values with the median age of 33.0. Company size and country columns were also recoded for consistency, improving data quality and preparing these features for modeling."

        "*   **Purpose:** This code systematically identifies columns that exhibit a binary-like structure (i.e., containing only two non-NaN unique values, plus optional NaNs, within a predefined set of valid binary responses like 'yes', 'no', 0, 1). It first finds all columns with any binary-like values (`yn_cols`) and then filters them down to those with a *strictly* binary structure (`strictly_yn_cols`).\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** 15 columns were identified as having a strictly binary structure (including `self_empl_flag`, `tech_comp_flag`, `mh_coverage_flag`, `prev_employers_flag`, and the `sex_` dummy variables). These columns are suitable for direct numerical mapping (e.g., Yes/No to 1/0) or already represent binary states. No columns from the `yn_cols` list were excluded from `strictly_yn_cols`, meaning all initially identified binary-like columns passed the strict binary structure check."

It begins with the **identification and collection of all unique response values**, followed by the **definition of a comprehensive standardization map** to group similar responses into consistent categories. Finally, this **standardization map is applied** to the DataFrame, ensuring all Likert features are uniformly represented.\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** Through careful unique value identification, detailed map definition, and precise application, all textual Likert scale responses have been successfully prepared and standardized. This systematic approach resolves inconsistencies and sets the stage for accurate numerical encoding and subsequent modeling."

It then applies these numerical mappings to the appropriate Likert columns in the DataFrame, converting qualitative responses into ordinal numerical data.\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** All 13 Likert columns in `df_view_yn_likert` have been successfully mapped to numerical ordinal scales (e.g., 'Very easy' -> 1, 'No' -> 1, 'Never' -> 1, 'Not open at all' -> 1, with increasing numbers representing higher/more positive responses). This converts qualitative survey responses into a quantifiable format, making them suitable for statistical analysis and machine learning models. The data types of these columns are now `object` (as they were before, pandas often defaults to object for mixed data types even if the values are floats after mapping, indicating further type conversion might be needed if not handled as part of later steps)."

Second, any remaining NaNs after this logical imputation are filled using the median value of the column.\n",

Initial conditional imputation addressed 'not applicable' cases by setting NaNs to 0 based on whether treatment was sought and if a disorder was present. Subsequent median imputation filled any residual NaNs. This ensures the column is fully prepared with numerical values for analysis."

These conditions imply the question about the impact of *ineffective treatment* is not applicable.\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** NaNs in `mh_not_eff_treat_impact_on_work` were conditionally imputed with 0 based on whether treatment was sought or if a disorder existed. The number of NaNs in this column reduced from 468 to 399. This imputation correctly handles 'not applicable' scenarios for individuals who sought treatment (and thus are not in the 'not effectively treated' group) or have no disorder.\n"

It creates new binary columns for each unique value, *including* a separate column to indicate the presence of NaN values. These new boolean dummy columns are then converted to integers (0s and 1s).\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** The three specified Likert columns (`mh_medical_leave`, `mh_not_eff_treat_impact_on_work`, `mh_sharing_friends/fam_flag`) were successfully one-hot encoded. This process added 19 new integer columns (0s and 1s) to the DataFrame, with `_nan` columns explicitly capturing the missingness. The DataFrame's shape increased to `(1433, 64)`, indicating the addition of these new feature columns, effectively converting the remaining ordinal features with NaNs into a categorical representation."

It filters the data to include only rows where respondents live and work in one of the top 6 specified countries, then drops US state/territory columns. For `work_position`, it imputes NaNs with 'Not_Reported', multi-hot encodes positions (creating `role_` columns for tech-related roles), and derives a `tech_flag`. Finally, it imputes NaNs in `mh_hurt_on_career` and `mh_neg_view_cowork` with 'Not Reported' and one-hot encodes these and the country columns.\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** The DataFrame was significantly transformed. Rows not in the top 6 countries were removed, reducing the dataset to 1235 entries. `live_us_teritory` and `work_us_teritory` were dropped. `work_position` was multi-hot encoded into 8 `role_` columns (e.g., `role_developer`, `role_sysadmin`), and a `tech_flag` was created. `mh_hurt_on_career` and `mh_neg_view_cowork` had NaNs imputed with 'Not Reported'. `country_live`, `country_work`, `mh_hurt_on_career`, and `mh_neg_view_cowork` were one-hot encoded, expanding the DataFrame to `(1235, 88)`. This creates a robust set of numerical features from the original nominal data."

        "*   **Purpose:** This section initiates the processing of ordinal columns by first creating a new DataFrame instance (`df_view_yn_lik_nom_ord`) to maintain data integrity from previous steps. Subsequently, it identifies and collects all unique values present across these designated ordinal columns. This step is crucial for understanding the range and nature of responses, which is a prerequisite for defining appropriate numerical mappings.\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** A new DataFrame (`df_view_yn_lik_nom_ord`) was successfully created for dedicated ordinal column processing. All unique non-null values from the columns classified as ordinal have been identified and listed, providing a comprehensive overview necessary for developing accurate and consistent numerical mappings in subsequent steps."

It specifically investigates whether the presence of missing values (NaNs) in employer-related and other contextual columns is systematically linked to a respondent being self-employed. This analysis helps identify which missing data points can be logically considered 'not applicable' for self-employed individuals.\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** The analysis confirmed a strong correlation between being self-employed (`self_empl_flag` == 1) and missing values in columns such as `comp_no_empl`, `tech_comp_flag`, `mh_coverage_flag`, and various employer-specific questions. This indicates that these questions are often not applicable to self-employed individuals, thereby justifying a targeted imputation strategy for these specific NaN values."

This ensures that the absence of an employer-related context for self-employed individuals is numerically represented.\n",

This significantly reduced the number of missing values in these columns, providing a consistent numerical representation for 'not applicable' cases and preparing the data for further processing.\n"

If `prev_employers_flag` is 0 (meaning the respondent had no previous employers) and a value in one of these 'prev...' columns is NaN, that NaN is imputed with 0. This treats the missing values as 'not applicable' for individuals with no previous employers.\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** NaNs in the 9 'prev...' ordinal columns were successfully imputed with 0 for all respondents who indicated they had no previous employers. This further reduced the NaN counts in these columns. However, 804 NaNs still remain in these columns, indicating that missingness also exists for respondents who *did* have previous employers but did not provide an answer."

        "*   **Purpose:** This code imputes NaNs in the `prev_mh_importance_employer` column based on its relationship with `prev_mh_benefits`. Specifically, if `prev_mh_importance_employer` is NaN AND `prev_mh_benefits` is 3 (meaning 'Yes, they all did' or similar positive response), then `prev_mh_importance_employer` is imputed with 3. This assumes that if previous employers provided mental health benefits, they also took mental health seriously.\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** 31 rows where `prev_mh_importance_employer` was NaN and `prev_mh_benefits` was 3 were successfully imputed. This reduced the NaN count in `prev_mh_importance_employer` from 229 to 198. This imputation leverages a logical relationship between two survey responses to fill in missing data, assuming a strong correlation.\n"

It groups the data by other columns and calculates the proportion of NaNs in `prev_mh_importance_employer` within each group. This helps identify which other features are predictive of missingness in the target column, which can guide further imputation strategies (e.g., using KNN).\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** The analysis identified 66 numerical features (out of 86 total columns) that show a varying proportion of NaNs in `prev_mh_importance_employer` across their categories. This indicates that the missingness in `prev_mh_importance_employer` is not random and is related to other aspects of the survey responses (e.g., `self_empl_flag`, `age`, `sex_` categories, various `role_` flags, country, and other `mh_` and `prev_mh_` related questions). These features can be used as predictors for more advanced imputation techniques like KNN."

        "### Purpose and Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Purpose:** This multi-step block addresses the remaining NaNs in ordinal columns using different strategies. It first performs median imputation for `prev_mh_discussion` and `prev_mh_discussion_supervisor`. Then, it creates a DataFrame `df_view_nan` where NaNs in other remaining ordinal columns are replaced with -1. Finally, it creates `df_view_ohe_nan` where NaNs in `prev_mh_benefits`, `prev_mh_importance_employer`, and `prev_mh_discuss_neg_conseq` are handled by one-hot encoding them into a `_Was_NaN` column.\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** Median imputation successfully filled NaNs in `prev_mh_discussion` and `prev_mh_discussion_supervisor`. For columns like `comp_no_empl`, `prev_mh_resources`, etc., NaNs were replaced with -1 in `df_view_nan`. For `prev_mh_benefits`, `prev_mh_importance_employer`, and `prev_mh_discuss_neg_conseq`, their NaNs were explicitly captured through one-hot encoding into new `_Was_NaN` columns in `df_view_ohe_nan`. This approach provides different ways to represent missingness (median, -1, or OHE), catering to various modeling needs and ensuring all ordinal columns are fully numerical."

        "\n",
        "*   **Purpose:** This code creates a new DataFrame `df_view_blony` and applies conditional imputation to several binary columns related to employers (`tech_comp_flag`, `mh_coverage_flag`, `mh_employer_discussion`, `mh_resources_provided`, `mh_conseq_coworkers`, `mh_bad_response_workplace`, `mh_family_hist`). If `self_empl_flag` is 1 (self-employed) and a value in one of these binary columns is NaN, that NaN is imputed with -1. This signifies 'not applicable' for self-employed individuals.\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** NaNs in the specified binary columns related to employers were successfully imputed with -1 for all self-employed individuals. For example, `tech_comp_flag` and `mh_coverage_flag` had 287 and 340 NaNs respectively before this step, and they both reduced to 0 NaNs after. Remaining NaNs in these columns are for non-self-employed individuals and will be addressed by further imputation strategies.\n",

If a respondent is *not* self-employed (`self_empl_flag` = 0), works for a medium-to-large company (`comp_no_empl` >= 3 on the ordinal scale), and indicates that their employer discusses mental health (`mh_employer_discussion` = 1) OR provides resources (`mh_resources_provided` = 1), and `mh_coverage_flag` is currently NaN, then `mh_coverage_flag` is imputed with 1 (Yes).\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** This imputation strategy successfully filled 58 NaNs in the `mh_coverage_flag` column. This indicates that for a significant number of non-self-employed individuals in medium/large companies, where employers actively engage in mental health discussions or resource provision, a missing `mh_coverage_flag` is likely a 'Yes'. The number of NaNs in `mh_coverage_flag` reduced from 340 to 0 after this step.\n",

The imputation logic is applied if `mh_coverage_flag` is 0 (No), `mh_employer_discussion` is 0 (No), `self_empl_flag` is 0 (Not self-employed), and `mh_resources_provided` is NaN. Under these conditions, `mh_resources_provided` is imputed with 0, assuming that if there's no coverage or discussion, there are also no resources provided.\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** The analysis revealed 135 rows meeting the specified conditions, where `mh_resources_provided` was mostly 0 (95% of non-NaN values). 9 NaNs in `mh_resources_provided` were successfully imputed with 0 based on this logic. This imputation ensures consistency, implying that if there's no mental health coverage or discussion from an employer, resources are also likely not provided."

        "*   **Purpose:** This code block performs one-hot encoding on the binary columns that still contained NaNs after previous logical imputations (`mh_coverage_flag`, `mh_employer_discussion`, `mh_resources_provided`, `mh_bad_response_workplace`, `mh_family_hist`). It creates new binary columns for each unique value, including a `_nan` column to explicitly represent missingness, and converts these to integers.\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** The specified binary columns were successfully one-hot encoded. This process added new integer columns (0s and 1s) representing each category and explicitly handled original NaN values with dedicated `_nan` columns. The DataFrame's shape increased to `(1235, 113)`, which is larger than the `(1235, 102)` initially expected, suggesting a greater diversity in unique values (including original NaNs, 0, 1, or -1 as categories) than anticipated. This ensures all missing data in these binary columns is represented numerically."

Then, it applies `pd.get_dummies` (without `dummy_na=True` as -1 explicitly handles 'not applicable') and converts the resulting boolean columns to integers.\n",

This process added 6 new integer columns to the DataFrame. The final shape of the DataFrame is `(1235, 117)`, completing the numerical conversion of all these specific binary and their missing value representations into numerical format."
